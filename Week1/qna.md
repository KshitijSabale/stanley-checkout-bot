I just wanted to understand how things usually work here when someone gets selected for a project posted in the group. Could you help me with a few questions, just to get a clear idea before I take up any project?
When someone is selected for a project, how do they usually start?
Do people normally sign any kind of contract or agreement?
Is there usually a fixed timeline or deadline shared by the person posting the project?
How is the payment part handled? Do you recommend confirming the payment details before starting?
What if there’s any issue or misunderstanding — can someone reach out to you or the mods?
Any general things to be careful about before starting work?

I just want to be sure I follow the best practices here and avoid any confusion later. Would love any advice you have!
